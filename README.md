Bendy was a lil' devil thing
Who was brought to life on the silver screen
Used to make em chuckle now he makes em scream

It's Bendy in the Devil's Swing

Flash back to the place that made the cartoons sing
Where the cobwebs grow and the floorboards creak
And it's all connected to an evil scheme
It's Bendy and the Ink Machine

Dreams do come true
I was deceived by Joey Drew and now I'm coming after you...
Who's laughing now
You thought that you could cut me out? But now the ink is pouring down

Bendy was created out of ink
And then molded into a 3D beast
You can hear him coming by his tapping feet
It's Bendy in the Devil's Swing

Snap back to the era when the swing was king
But the workshops fading and behind the scenes
There's a deep dark secret hidden underneath
It's Bendy and the Ink Machine

Hey Joey I got your message
There's still a sketch on my old work desk
It might have a been a bit overzealous
To collect all six of those office relics

I haven't seen my peers
In over years
But there's no one here
Except grinding gears
And my rising fears

The illusion of living
Was only the beginning
Ink incarnate that's sinning
Presented in Sillyvision
The illusion of living
Was only the beginning
Ink incarnate that's sinning
Presented in Sillyvision

Bendy was a villain out of sync
Now he's off the page and he's on the brink
And his old pal Boris might have lost a spleen
It's Bendy in the Devil's Swing

A cartoon cutout that'll make you shriek
Yeah your heart starts racing when you hear that beat!
The creator's brain might have sprung a leak
It's Bendy and the Ink Machine

1-2-3
To 3D
You and Me
Ink Machine

Flashing Screens
Dancing Fiend
Bendy Sings
Devil's Swing

(Dreams do come true, i was deceived by Joey Drew and now im coming after youu~.
Who's laughing now, you thought that you could cut me out and now the ink is pouring downn~)

Bendy was a lil' devil thing
Who was brought to life on the silver screen
Used to make em chuckle now he makes em scream
It's Bendy in the Devil's Swing

Flash back to the place that made the cartoons sing
Where the cobwebs grow and the floorboards creek
And it's all connected to an evil scheme
It's Bendy and the Ink Machine!
